          <h2>Summary</h2>
          <p>
            Since the announcement that the current go-to L2 NFT Marketplace
            solutions are being sunsetted, a race has begun to provide an
            alternative. A few L2 Maxis have formed an all-star team with a
            novel approach to build a self-sustaining marketplace, Hyperdrive.
            This will be unique in that our vision is for Hyperdrive to
            authentically be a marketplace for the people, with customizable
            Creator pages and an open-sourced codebase from the start.
            Additionally, incentives for becoming a code contributor will ensure
            those most invested in the success of the project will be successful
            themselves, and that the marketplace never loses sight of its users’
            needs - creating a long-term positive reinforcement loop.
          </p>

            When we got together as a new team focused on one goal (on the topic
            of L2 NFT Marketplaces) we started seeing more and more
            opportunities for a better user experience. We started with the idea
            that this should be a marketplace that is as every bit as diverse as
            it is separate; but with commingled communities. Our team is
            comprised of experts in their fields and we have already challenged
            each other on core concepts but one thing we came into a consensus
            with early on was that this would be an L2-focused product because
            we firmly believe in L2&apos;s as the sane alternative to high fees,
            and because of how engaged their communities are. Even through this
            bear market, the OptiChads and some other projects have continued to
            show promising volume and rising floor prices.

            Dicaso, the creator of OptiChads, the first NFT project on Optimism
            to receive funding through OP Governance, is leading the charge on
            Hyperdrive to ensure economic incentives are aligned with its user
            base. DistractionBoy is a co-founder of Optimistic Bunnies and
            OptiChads, and is a Senior Software Engineer (specializing in User

            13 years of experience as a freelancer for hire. Weston Nelson,
            brings a background of finance and strategy to the team, working in
            TradFi for several years, with most time spent at Fidelity
            Investments, before transitioning to Web3 full-time. He’s also part
            of Layer2DAO, and will contribute to Hyperdrive in conducting market
            research into future airdrops and incentives for core contributors.

          <h2>Proposal for token distribution</h2>
          <p>
            Hyperdrive’s goal here is to provide a novel and unique platform for
            the L2 NFT ecosystem. This means building flexible and robust reward
            mechanisms for users and creators - beginning with the creation of a
            token native to the exchange, $HD. This is to facilitate value
            creation and decentralized governance.
          </p>

          <h3>How will the OP tokens be distributed?</h3>
          <ol role="list">
            <li>
              15,500 OP (56%) towards new NFT marketplace build, token launch
            </li>
            <li>
              12,000 OP (46%) to set up extra incentives for bringing new
              creators and artists to the platform and bootstrapping liquidity
              for the DAO.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed?</h3>
          <p>We expect to use this grant funding within 2 months.</p>

          <h3>How will this distribution support the Layer2DAO vision?</h3>
          <p>
            Many people in Layer2DAO have come to enjoy trading NFTs on L2 and
            we plan to build this out and attract even more users to the L2 NFT
            ecosystem, creating a win-win scenario for all.{" "}
