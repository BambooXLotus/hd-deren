Every time she sees you glance in her direction she smiles and the light from her yellow canopy reflects delicately off of her golden brown skin. Another one, much further down the alley, keeps shoving her fish in the face of passers-by yelling, &lsquo;FRESH FISH!&rsquo;. There&apos;s a vendor with who makes fresh breakfast sandwiches every morning and is always fun to talk to but his booth has no frills and the sandwiches are his only product. One vendor in particular always catches your eye because they sell tickets to that thing you really want to do one day when you have enough time and you keep checking the prices to see if they ever drop to a reasonable price.

Over time these creators can have quests, giveaways, upcoming promotional material for new collections, and more. What Quix and OpenSea did very well was load collections of NFT&apos;s quickly, and they have their own ways of highlighting different collections, but we think the focus should be on the Creators and their own little shop on the street rather than just the individual collections. Also, we want them to be able to customize their &quo;shop&quo; as they see fit. It should look how they want it to look, and be their primary marketing tool.
