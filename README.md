## Getting Started As A Developer

Before continuing further, check out Rush's Prerequisites and Caveats in their [documentation](https://rushjs.io/pages/developer/new_developer/)

Install Rush CLI with `npm install -g @microsoft/rush`

Install all dependencies with `rush install` from repository root directory

## Common Commands

Generally speaking, you should not need to run these commands often, because adding npm packages should generally be a process that is carefully considered and done sparingly. But if you need to add a package, please try to make that its own separate commit with its own separate Pull Request. However in the beginning of this project we plan to try a lot of stuff out and it might be needed to add a package and implement it in the same Pull Request.

### rush update

Remember to run rush update whenever a **package.json** file has changed. In other words:

- After pulling new changes from git (e.g. git pull)
- After manually editing any project's package.json file in any way
- After editing any common/config files that affect versions (e.g. pnpmfile.js, common-versions.json, etc.)

The rush update operation may change some files under **common/config**. If so, you should commit those changes to Git and include them in your PR. When in doubt, run rush update -- if everything is already up to date, it won't take any time!

What rush update does:

1. Rush checks/applies various policies that sometimes update files under common/config.
2. Rush compares all of your project **package.json** files against the repository's common shrinkwrap file to see if it's valid.
3. If it's outdated, the package manager updates the shrinkwrap file.
4. Either way, the package manager installs all dependencies into the common/temp/node_modules folder.
5. Finally, Rush constructs a local **node_modules** folder for each project, by making symlinks into common/temp/node_modules. (This is the same operation as rush link.)

### rush rebuild

Once you've pulled the latest changes, it's time to compile everything. `rush rebuild` does a full, clean build of every project in the repository.

If your toolchain supports incremental builds, you can also use `rush build` to build only the projects that have changed.

### build commands

Each folder inside of **/projects/** is its own separate buildable project with its own build commands, but we just so happen to be using NextJS for all our apps, so you can just run `npm run dev` and it will start that project's local build at http://localhost:3000

### make commands
Another easy way is use make command 
```bash
Management commands for Hyperdrive:
Usage:
    make                       Prepares and setup up project with default settings
    make help                  Show this menu
    make dev-aggregate         Start development aggregate site
    make dev-creators          Start development creators site
    make dev-marketing         Start development marketing site
